# Hangman-Project

The Hangman project in Python is a simple text-based game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters, one at a time. The game displays the word with blanks for unknown letters and updates the display with each correct or incorrect guess. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends. The project demonstrates basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and user input handling, making it an ideal beginner project for learning Python.

### 1. Run the Game:
Once you have the Python script (e.g., hangman.py), open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the folder containing the script.

### 2. Start Playing:
The game will randomly select a word (from a predefined list or a file).
The word will be represented by blank spaces, with each blank corresponding to a letter in the word.
You'll be prompted to guess a letter.

### 3. Guessing:
Enter a letter when prompted. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.
If the letter is not in the word, the number of incorrect attempts will increase, and part of the "hangman" figure will be drawn (typically starting from the head and progressing to the body, arms, and legs).

### 4. Winning or Losing:
Win: If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, you win the game, and the word is revealed.
Lose: If you run out of incorrect guesses (usually 6 or 7), the game ends, and the full hangman figure is drawn. The correct word will be shown.

### 5. Game Continuation:
After each game, the program may ask if you want to play again. You can choose to continue or exit.
Example:
less
Copy code
_ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: a

Correct! The word is: _ a _ _ _
Guess a letter: e

Incorrect! Attempts left: 5
The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
